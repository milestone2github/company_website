                Debt Mutual Funds primarily invest in fixed-income securities like government bonds, corporate bonds, treasury bills, and money market instruments. These funds are ideal for investors looking for stable income with lower risk compared to equity investments.
                <br><br>
                Debt funds come with varying maturity periods and risk levels, ranging from short-term to long-term investments. They provide better liquidity compared to fixed deposits and are more tax-efficient for investors in higher tax brackets. Moreover, debt funds are less volatile, making them suitable for conservative investors and those with short-term financial goals.
                <br><br>
                While debt funds are considered safer than equity funds, they are not risk-free. Interest rate movements and credit risk can affect their performance. Itâ€™s crucial for investors to align their fund selection with their risk appetite and investment horizon.
